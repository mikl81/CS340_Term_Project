README
    This program was created by Michael Fitzgibbon Perry (AKA FitzPerry) and Jonathan Ektefaie during Fall 2025 for CS340.
    This project represents a theoretical backend driven website for a potential online review service, Bits-N-Pixels.
    Our service is running on NodeJS with a MySQL database with a Handlebars Engine. Our website features navigation and display of each entity in the database, driven by select statments. We have implemented CRUD functionality for the M-M database, Lists-to-Games. All user input is sanitized from injection attacks by utilizing stored procedures found in our PL.SQL file.
